# Project Title
MICROGOLF

## Overview
The layout of Microgolf consists of 50 “holes” arranged in a vertical line. One of the holes is randomly designated by the UI
thread as the winning hole. Two worker threads take turns shooting a virtual ball into a hole of their choosing.
The first thread to shoot its ball into the winning hole wins the game.
The 50 holes are partitioned into 5 “hole groups”. Each group contains 10 adjacent holes. 
Whenever one of the two player threads shoots a ball into a hole, the game system
provides one of four possible responses:
1. Jackpot—This happens if the thread shot the ball into the winning hole.
2. Near miss—This happens if the thread missed the winning hole, but shot into hole in the same group as
the winning hole.
3. Near group—This happens if the thread shot a ball into a hole whose group is adjacent to the group
containing the winning hole.
4. Big miss—This happens if ball misses by more than one group.
5. Catastrophe—This happens if the ball falls into a hole already currently occupied by the other player’s
ball. In this case, the player is immediately disqualified and the other player wins the game.
Threads can choose one of four possible shots.
* Random—This shot will end in any of the fifty possible holes. This is the only option available when a
thread makes its first move.
* Close group—This shot will end in a random hole either in the same group as the previous shot by the
same player, or an adjacent group.
* Same group—This shot will end in a random hole in the same group as the previous shot by the same
player.
* Target hole—This shot will end in a hole specified by a player thread.

A thread will never shoot in the same hole twice during an entire game, no matter what kind of shot the thread chose.
The project has two Java worker threads playing against each other. The UI thread is responsible for creating and starting the two worker threads, for maintaining and updating the display, and for notifying the worker threads the outcomes of their moves. Each worker thread will take turns with the other thread taking the following actions:
1. Waiting for a short time (1-2 seconds) in order for a human viewer to take note of the previous move on the display.
2. Figuring out the next shot of this thread.
3. Communicating this shot to the UI thread.
4. Waiting for a response from the UI thread.

The UI thread is specifically responsible for the following functionality:
1. Showing the current hole display. The display should include a vertical array of the holes, highlight the
winning hole, as well as the most recent shots by the two player threads. Use, for instance, different
colors to distinguish the holes shot by the two players and the winning hole. The displaying of the holes
should be scrollable if the screen is too small to display the entire array.
2. Notifying player threads of the outcome of their shots.
3. Updating the display after each shot.
4. Determining whether one player has won the game.
5. Signaling the two worker threads that the game is over; the two threads should stop their execution as a
result of this action.
6. Displaying the outcome of the game in the UI.
